	<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
	<p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 21, 2026</p>

	<p>
		Welcome to Bearprompt ("we", "us", or "our"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. 
		This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our website at 
		<a href="https://bearprompt.com">bearprompt.com</a> (the "Service").
	</p>

	<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
	<p>
		<strong>We do not collect any personal data.</strong> Bearprompt is designed with privacy as a core principle. 
		All your prompts and data are stored locally in your browser using IndexedDB technology. 
		We have no access to your prompts, tags, or any content you create within the application.
	</p>

	<h2>2. Local Data Storage</h2>
	<p>
		All data you create in Bearprompt (prompts, tags, settings) is stored exclusively in your browser's 
		local storage (IndexedDB). This means:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Your data never leaves your device</li>
		<li>We cannot access, read, or recover your data</li>
		<li>If you clear your browser data, your prompts will be deleted</li>
		<li>Your data is not synced across devices unless you manually export and import it</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>3. Analytics</h2>
	<p>
		We use <a href="https://umami.is" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Umami Analytics</a> 
		to collect anonymous usage statistics. Umami is a privacy-friendly analytics tool that:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Does not use cookies</li>
		<li>Does not collect personal data</li>
		<li>Does not track users across websites</li>
		<li>Is fully compliant with GDPR, CCPA, and PECR</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		The data collected includes anonymous information such as page views, referral sources, 
		browser type, and country of origin. This helps us understand how the Service is used 
		and how we can improve it.
	</p>

	<h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
	<p>
		Apart from Umami Analytics, we do not integrate any third-party services that would 
		collect your data. We do not use advertising networks, social media trackers, or any 
		other external services that could compromise your privacy.
	</p>

	<h2>5. Data Security</h2>
	<p>
		Since all your data is stored locally on your device, you are in full control of its security. 
		We recommend:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Regularly backing up your prompts using the export feature</li>
		<li>Using a secure and up-to-date browser</li>
		<li>Being cautious when using shared or public computers</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
	<p>
		Our Service is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect any 
		information from children under 13.
	</p>

	<h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
	<p>
		We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes 
		by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date.
	</p>
